# PromptLayer Real-Time Suggestion Feature - Building Plan

## **Overview**
Build a real-time prompt analysis feature that suggests improvements to users' LLM prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The feature will show suggestions in a bubble when Claude returns anything other than "NO_CHANGE".

    - Every 10 words
    - Every 20 words
    - Every 50 words
    - 500ms after typing stops
    - 1 second after typing stops

- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3.2 Response Processing
- [ ] Parse Claude responses
- [ ] Detect "NO_CHANGE" vs actual suggestions
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully
- [ ] Implement basic caching for similar prompts

---

## **Phase 5: Integration & Testing**
*Goal: Connect all components and ensure reliability*

### 5.1 End-to-End Integration
- [x] Connect settings â†’ monitoring â†’ analysis â†’ display
- [x] Test on all target platforms
- [x] Handle edge cases (empty prompts, very long text, etc.)

### 5.2 Error Handling & Performance
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling
- [x] Add performance monitoring
- [x] Optimize for minimal performance impact
- [x] Test with slow network conditions

---

## **Phase 6: MVP Polish**
*Goal: Prepare for initial release*

### 6.1 User Experience Refinements
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions
